# ServerSideApis-Homework
I had a couple of issues developing this app.  The most noticable issue was the search button's formatting.  While the button is visible, it doesn't look much like a proper search button.  I tried to fix it, but failed.  Additionally, while searching for a city does indeed display the weather as expected, the "Popular Cities" buttons do not work.

The script.js file was complicated, with functions to display date and time, to pull weather data from the API and to store user input.

The API used is OpenWeatherMap.
